# Sentiment Analysis
 Analyzing over 40000 movie reviews and training a neural network to successfully classify them


 Creating a Sentiment Analysis Classifier using Python & PyTorch.

Goals:

Accurately predict the sentiment of a review
Use a RNN Neural Network to analyze and classify the text.
Use hugging face to upload a good working classifier that can be used by anyone.
Aim to get an accuracy of atleast 85% to ensure reliability in results.
First Completion Notes:

Learned about RNNs (GRU mainly and a bit about LSTM)
Learned how to manipulate large datasets (40000 reviews) and tokenize them
Successfully built a custom model that brings a reliable accuracy of 88.2%
New Goals:

Make a usable application using huggingface (in progress)
